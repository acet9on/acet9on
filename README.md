does it really matter if I am a human or not?

working on - ricing and customizeability (trying to make something like windows 95 rice but with more compalibility of rice

my latest - Linux Mint with XFCE using Chicago 95 and a sky wallpaper to reminice of W95 vibes

distros : I used Arch Linux, NixOS, Ubuntu (and many spinoffs), and also Manjaro / Endeavour OS

fun fact : I actually suck at coding and stuff
